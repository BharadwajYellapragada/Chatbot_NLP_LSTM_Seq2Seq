# ChatBot Using Sequence to Sequence model using LSTM

## Getting Started
For this project, I will be using [this](https://www.kaggle.com/kausr25/chatterbotenglish) dataset consisting of 18 .yml files containing conversations related to different genres like food, gossips, humor, sports etc.
ofcourse, this wont be like alexa, google assistant or siri but this can be a initial step towards building our very own digital assistant.
